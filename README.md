# BlackjackGame
My take on the classic game through javascript

This is just the initial version. I will update it and complete the game by adding more functionabilty and interactivity.

I will briefly explain the files uploaded.

1. index.html

Very little coding written. The whole HTML file is divided into a few divs and buttons. They have given id's and classes.
CSS and Javascript has been linked.

2. Style.css

Once again, they have been keep to minimal styling.
Hovering has been added to the buttons.

3. Blackjack.js

This is th main javascript file. Elements have been manipulated through the DOM.
I have created and implemented a few functions. 
First I have declared the variables of the deck and the player.
Initialized the function.

The main functions include:
1. The deck function
2. The players function
3. Starting the game function
4. Dealing the hand function
5. Updating the deck function
6. Rendering the card and player function
7. Get the points function
8. Hit me function
9. Hold function
10. End(game over) function


NEXT STEPS:

This is just the beginning of the game. I plan to add and improve many part of the game and make it enjoyable.
